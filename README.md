This project entails the development of a sophisticated parcel service application, designed to streamline the process of package management for both users and administrators. The application facilitates the creation, viewing, tracking, and status management of parcels through an intuitive and user-friendly web interface. It ensures end-to-end visibility for customers by providing real-time updates on the location and delivery status of their packages.
